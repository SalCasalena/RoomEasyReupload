My name is Samuel Master and I am a first year student studying Computer Science at Drexel University. I have a little bit of prior experience in Java, C#, Python, Swift, and HTML, and am currently working with Dart and Python. Currently my primary experience in the past has been in IOS app development using Swift, but I have also learned introductory information on fields like cryptography.
