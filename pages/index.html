            <h1>Welcome to Blitz Automotive</h1>

            <p>
            Blitz Automotive is a full service repair facility. Family owned in Kennett Square since 1970, our purpose is to provide the best quality service possible to our clients in a professional and timely manner.
            </p>

            <p>

            <p>
            Bob first became interested in the automotive field when he went to his first drag race in Atco, New Jersey and stood right next to the starting line at the age of 15. He got his first car the following August, a 1956 Chevy which is still in the family today. Bob began racing autos in 1966. His passion for cars, racing, and building engines led him to the formation of his own speed shop on February 7th, 1970. After a few years he moved the shop to a new location and began including full service repair in his services. In 1984, he moved to the current location at 465 E State Street. In 1991 he added a full service in-house machine shop. It has remained full service including PA State & Emissions inspections. Today with over 40 years of experience in the automotive field, Blitz Automotive stands above the rest in quality automotive repair and service.
