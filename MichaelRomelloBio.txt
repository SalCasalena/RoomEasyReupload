Hello, my name is Michael Romello and I’m studying software engineering.

When I was in high school I realized my passion for SE and I began taking dual
enrollment classes to amass credits before college.

At the end of my 4 years of high school I’d managed 61 semester credits which
when transferred to Drexel became 91 credits.
